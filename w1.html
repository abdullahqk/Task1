        If u were to somehow posses the ability to look into the far, deep and
        dark reaches of space, you would find an endless sea of stars, planets,
        galaxies and blackholes. Or maybe you would see a great void of nothing
        but absolute darkness. Terrifying isn't it? What if I told you there's a
        star out there far away from here that sits lonely waiting to burn out?
        A star that was birthed shortly after the big bang.

      <h3>Earendel</h3>
      <p>
        It's through this trick of
        <a

          title="Goes to wiki page"
          target="_blank"
          >gravitational lensing</a
        >
        that astronomers could detect the most distant known single star, named
        Earendel (yes, that's a "Lord of the Rings" reference, which comes from
        the Anglo-Saxon myth of the Morning Star), which currently sits over 28
        billion light-years away. That star arrived on the cosmic scene a mere
        900 million years after the Big Bang, putting it within reach of the
        first generation of stars to appear in the universe.Employing a similar
        gravitational lensing technique, astronomers used the James Webb Space
        Telescope to precisely measure the distance to
        <big><bold>JADES-GS-z13-0</bold></big
        >, the most distant known galaxy. It is currently found over 33.6
        billion light-years away and formed when our universe was a mere 400
        million years old.
      </p>
      <h3>Is this the farthest we can see?</h3>
      <p>
        Astronomers suspect there are other signals coming from even deeper in
        the past. For example, exotic processes in the earliest moments of the
        Big Bang generated a flood of ghostly particles known as neutrinos, and
        the hunt is on for this relic population. Even more exotic processes
        within the first second of the Big Bang likely swamped the cosmos in
        gravitational waves. Proposed missions like the Big Bang Observer might
        catch the faint traces of this leftover signal. If detected, it would be
        by far the most distant thing we could ever possibly see.
